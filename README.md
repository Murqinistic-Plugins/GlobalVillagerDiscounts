**Synchronize villager curing discounts across all players on your server!**

## 📖 Description

GlobalVillagerDiscounts shares villager trade discounts among all players. When any player earns a discount by **curing a zombie villager**, that discount becomes available to **everyone** on the server.

### How It Works

1. Player cures a zombie villager → earns discount
2. Plugin captures and stores the discount (by recipe hash)
3. Any other player trading with that villager gets the same discount
4. Best discount always wins
5. Discounts auto-clear on profession change

> **Note:** Hero of the Village discounts are **not** shared (temporary effect).

## ✨ Features
