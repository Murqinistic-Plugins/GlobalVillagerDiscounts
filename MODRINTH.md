# GlobalVillagerDiscounts

**Synchronize villager curing discounts across all players on your server!**

## Description

GlobalVillagerDiscounts is a lightweight plugin that shares villager trade discounts among all players. When any player earns a discount by **curing a zombie villager**, that discount becomes available to **everyone** on the server.

### How It Works

1. Player cures a zombie villager → earns discount
2. Plugin captures and stores the discount (in PersistentDataContainer)
3. Any other player trading with that villager gets the same discount
4. Best discount always wins

> **Note:** Hero of the Village discounts are **not** shared (they're temporary player effects).
